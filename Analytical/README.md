# Analytical
Reduced order apparent optical property modeling that resolves to an analytical expression.

Single material structured surfaces:
External structures: available in hexagonally packed extruded cylinders, hexagonally packed spheres.
Embedded cavities: available in hexagonally packed embedded circular cylindrical cavities, triangular and square grooves.
Thin walled structures: available in hexagonal and rectangular fences.

Multi-material structured surfaces:
Embedded cavities: same as single material.

Todo: Streamline functions to call view factor functions and area functions, rather than have them all singular functions. 
Todo: Convert to julia (.jl) for portability/parallelizability.
