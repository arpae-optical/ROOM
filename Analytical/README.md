# Analytical
Reduced order apparent optical property modeling that resolves to an analytical expression.

Single material structured surfaces:
External structures: available in hexagonally packed extruded cylinders, hexagonally packed spheres.
Embedded cavities: available in hexagonally packed embedded circular cylindrical cavities, triangular and square grooves.

Multi-material structured surfaces:
Embedded cavities: same as single material.
