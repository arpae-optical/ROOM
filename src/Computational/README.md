# Computational

For arrangements of structured surfaces unable to determine apparent optical properties analytically, these codes will help determine them computationally.
Either Monte Carlo or direct numerical simulation of the approximate geometry will be used to determine view factors, and then net radiosity method to determine apparent optical properties.
Run test_mc_vs_dns to compare computational accuracy and cost of the two methods for a hexagonal enclosure. 

Todo: Compare MC to DNS for hex walls, cylindrical structure.
